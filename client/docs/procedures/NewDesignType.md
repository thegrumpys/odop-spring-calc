# Procedure to implement a new design type 

This entry describes how to implement a new ODOP design type 
(a.k.a. "design problem").

Each design type gets its own sub-directory within the source code.
The design equations for a specific design type are contained in a source code
file named eqnset.js.

**Files required for all design types:**   
 &nbsp; (<sup> * </sup> = may be stub)   
* client/src/designtypes/_designName_/
    * initialState.js
    * symbol_table.js - for symbol table access by index
    * offsets.js  - for p and x vector access by index
    * eqnset.js
    * init.js<sup> * </sup>
    * view.js<sup> * </sup>
    * size.js<sup> * </sup>
    * catalog.js<sup> * </sup>
    * execute.js<sup> * </sup>
    * migrate.js
* client/public/designtypes/_designName_/favicon.icon
* designtypes/_designName_/load.sql
* docs/Help/DesignTypes/_designName_.md 
   
* "Startup" entry in database  (typically created from initialState.js)
   
**Additional (or non-stub) files may (optionally) be utilized by some design types.**    
For example, coil spring design types utilize:   
 &nbsp; (<sup> ** </sup> = non stub)   
* client/src/designtypes/Spring/
    * mat\_ips.json,  mat\_cgs.json, etc.
    * mat\_ips\_offsets.js, mat\_cgs\_offsets.js, etc.
    * wire_dia_xx.json &nbsp; (standard wire sizes tables)
* client/src/designtypes/Spring/_designName_/
    * init.js<sup> ** </sup>
    * view.js<sup> ** </sup>
    * size.js<sup> ** </sup>
    * catalog.js<sup> ** </sup>
    * execute.js<sup> ** </sup> &nbsp;  (references exec, tutor & demo)
        * execxx.js &nbsp; (e.g. increasePrecision.js)
        * tutorxx.js
        * demoxx.js
    * endtypes.json
    * lifetarget.json
    * heattreat.json
    * prop_calc.json
    * catalog.json (stock springs catalog)


**Modify template files:**   
* Using an existing initialState.js file as an example, modify it to reflect the variables of the new design type.
* Start with initialState and then use the **View : Offsets ** menu item as a copy / paste source for the contents of offsets.js.   
    * expect issues as this requires ability to get past compile time and run-time errors
* Using an existing eqnset.js file as an example, replace equations with the design equations of the new design type.
* Use stub versions of init, report, size, catalog, execute and migrate to get started.
* Add an icon with the name favicon.icon to client/public/designtypes
* Create a Startup entry in the database   
    * When in developer mode, and database access is enabled   
        * Start from initialState   
        * Optionally, make modifications. 
        * Save As Startup.   

* Create a load.sql file   
 ---- Using an existing load.sql file as an example, overwrite the initialState section with the new initial state json.   
 ---- {need more detail here} ...   
 ---- See also: [Making changes to initialState.js](initialStateChanges.html)
   
**Build a new GitHub repository ?**   
* plug-ins ?

**Test.**

**Notes as of early September, 2018 ...**

The replacement for CONTNT is named init.js. 
It is called on every change to (any variable?, not just) a "Calculation Input" (every keystroke).

Regarding properties of Elements (entries, members, variables) in initialState.js:   
* "input": true or false  
* "type": "equationset" or "calcinput"
* "hidden": true or false   

Elements with the property ("input": true) are inputs to the design equations and go into the p vector. 
Fixed elements are compressed out and not operated on by Search.
Elements with the property ("Input": false) are output from (modified by) either init.js or eqnset.js and go into the x vector.
The d vector has been eliminated.  Those elements are now distributed between the p and x vectors.
The current implementation for the compression spring design type has essentially all of the 
former members of the d vector appearing as elements in x.
This is partially for simplicity.
Note that changes to the p vector are not saved into the state of the design. 
Thus, unexpected results (stale data) can occur if elements are moved into p and they later change.
This stale data issue is not a concern for elements of x.

Elements with the property ("type": "equationset"), are fixable and constrainable ("unrestricted" in the terminology above).
Elements with the property ("type": "calcinput"), are members of the previous d vector ("restricted" in the previous terminology).

Elements with the property ("hidden": true) are not visible in the user interface.

**The rules for defining elements (entries, members, variables) in initialState.js:**   

Any variable on the left of an equals sign in either init.js or eqnset.js **must** be ("input": false) ... in the x vector.

Any variable appearing **only** on the right of an equal sign in both init.js and eqnset.js may be ("input": true) ... in the p vector.
Note that x variables may also appear on the right of an equals sign.
This has no relevance to their assignment as ("input": false).
When in doubt, it is generally safe (safer) to assign an element as ("input": false).

While single line comments work as expected, a multi-line comment must be the last thing in the file.
Eclipse .md Preview suppresses display of everything after the comment header.
