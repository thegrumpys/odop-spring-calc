# Image locations

When contemplating a location (directory path) for image files,
consider that there are two worlds (Heroku & GitHub Pages) with differing requirements.

Any images referenced in demo and tutorial sessions should be located in "public":   
odop/client/public/designtypes/xxx/imagename    

Any images in Help (GitHub Pages) should be located in a "docs": subdirectory:   
odop/client/docs/Help/images/imagename   

See issues #243 & #244.
