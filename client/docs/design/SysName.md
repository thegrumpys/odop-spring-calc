# Proposed names for the (problem independent) system

The next phase of development will introduce multiple new design problems.
A new GitHub repository will likely be established.
These steps will be facilitated by establishing a name for the generic, not problem dependent, portion(s) of the system.

It may be possible to have a name for the problem independent portion of the system that will carry forward into each of the problems hosted by the system.
For example, XyzSys becomes NutSys, BoltSys, SpringSys, etc.
Similarly, Xyz:Platform can become Xyz:Nuts, Xyx:Bolts:, Xyz:Springs 

Current proposals include:

# Open Design Optimization System
* ODOSys

* ODO:System
* ODO : System
* OpenDesOpt:System

# Open Design Optimization Platform
* ODO:Platform
* ODO : Platform
* OpenDesOpt:Platform
* OpenDesignOpt:Platform

# Open Design Optimization App
* ODOapp
* ODO:app
