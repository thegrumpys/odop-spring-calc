# Investigate alternatives to assist implementation of the Execute, Demo and Tutorial features

**December 2019 update**   
This feature has been implemented without using any of the 3rd party alternatives below.   
&nbsp;

The Execute feature is the basis of demo and tutorial sessions in the CLI software.
The CLI EXECUTE command has provisions for:
 - user control of  pacing
 - comments that add descriptive annotations around the command being interpreted.

Audio support in order to create voice-over tutorials is desirable, but not required.

Other possibilities include YouTube videos and open source and commercial software.
