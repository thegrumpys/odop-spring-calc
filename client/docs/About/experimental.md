# Experimental Software

The **O**pen **D**esign **O**ptimization **P**latform software 
and ODOP:Spring app are experimental and under development. 
Improvements are being released as frequently as one or more times per month. 
In addition to being constructed with great care and attention to detail, 
each new version of 
the software is subjected to extensive testing before release. 
Even so, you should expect to encounter operational issues and problems of varying severity.
Be sure to review the [Restrictions](Legal/Restrictions.html) page before committing to designs generated with this software.

Features allowing the user to save and / or export design data can help protect against certain problems.
Also, the latest release of the ODOP software implements a basic AutoSave feature. 
More detail is available at: [AutoSave](/docs/Help/autoSave.html).
