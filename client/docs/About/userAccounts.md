# User Accounts, Username, Sign-in, Sign-out

A user account is **not** required to operate most features of the software. 
If saving designs into the cloud-based (on-line) [ODOP Design Library](/docs/Help/terminology.html#designLib), 
it is necessary to establish a user account with associated unique username and password 
so as to keep those designs private. 

You can sign up for a private account within the app. 
Launch the ODOP software from the SpringDesignSoftware.org home page, 
Getting Started page or any of the three spring type pages. 
To establish a free private account, 
push the "Sign-in" button to the left of the File menu and then 
use the "Sign up" (Self-Service Registration) feature at the lower right of the sign-in page. 
After responding to an activation email message, 
your account will be ready for immediate sign-in.

Alternatively, send a request to: **Info@SpringDesignSoftware.org**. 
You will receive a reply message (welcome letter) with instructions on how to complete creating your account. 
This alternative contains one step that is not automated, 
so expect a delay of hours to a day or so. 
The welcome letter includes instructions on how to establish a password and if desired, 
change it in the future. 

Evaluators may sign-in with the username "public" and password "public". 
When operating in the public account, it is possible to save designs into the ODOP Design Library 
but keep in mind that all saved information will be completely public and modifiable. 
Designs saved in the public account do not have the same assurance of long-term storage 
as those saved in a private account. 
See [Restrictions](Legal/Restrictions.html) for long-term data storage policies. 

Once you have established a username and password, 
launch the ODOP software and push the "Sign-in" button to the left of the File menu 
in order to get to the sign-in page. 

The ODOP user account (username / password) feature is based on capabilities provided by 
[Okta](https://www.okta.com/). 
Do not expect the ODOP:Spring app to appear on Okta's list of apps and 
do not be concerned about a "You don't have any apps." message on your personal Okta home page 
(used for adding apps, changing or recovering passwords, etc.). 

An account username must be in the form of an email address. 
As noted in our [Privacy Notice](Legal/PrivacyStatement.html), 
your personal information will be secure and not abused. 
If you have any remaining concerns on this point, 
using an email account different than your primary email account is a reasonable approach.

See [Password reset](/docs/Help/htt.html#passwordReset) for instructions on how to 
change a password or recover from a lost password after account creation is complete. 
   
See [Default Designs](/docs/Help/defaultDesigns.html) for information on how a private design 
can be used to personalize system provided default designs. 

See [Restrictions](Legal/Restrictions.html) for long term data storage policies 
in both public and private accounts. 

The **File : Export** menu item allows design data to be preserved in local storage. 
For details, see: [Save, Save As, Import and Export](/docs/Help/htt.html#fileSaveAndSaveAs). 
 
Once signed in, your user session will remain active for as long as the browser window (tab) 
associated with the app exists and your Internet connection is maintained. 
Actually, the user session may persist for up to two hours after loss of Internet connection or 
closing a previous browser window or tab. 
In this situation, you may be able to open a new browser window (tab) and open a previously saved design without 
need to sign-in again. 
However, you should save frequently as once the browser window or tab is closed, 
any unsaved design in progress may be lost. 
For more information on this point, see: [AutoSave](/docs/Help/autoSave.html). 

## Troubleshooting sign in issues 
- Be sure to enter your email address in the "Username" field of the sign-in page.   
&nbsp;   

In order to sign out: 
  - Use the "Sign-out" button to the left of the File menu 
 
___ 
 
When invoked from the ODOP Sign-In, this page opens in a new browser tab. 
Switch tabs in order to return to that Sign-In page or simply close this tab.
