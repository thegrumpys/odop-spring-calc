# ODOP is:   


## OPEN   

As in Open Source Software. 
The program's source code is available to all at no cost. 
For additional information on open source concepts, see:

## DESIGN   

The ODOP software approaches "design" from an engineering perspective. 
Specifically, this notion of design is all about selecting appropriate values 
for those parameters that can be controlled in order to achieve the desired 
performance of an engineering system. 
A mathematical model of the system under investigation is required. 
While this is "computer-aided engineering design", 
computer graphics in the form of drafted drawings or 3D models are 
not central to this design process. 

While certainly capable of analyzing the performance of an existing design, 
ODOP is at its best when used to develop solutions to difficult and 
highly constrained original design problems. 

&nbsp;

## OPTIMIZATION   

Once a real world system is expressed in terms of a mathematical model, 
that model may be manipulated by numerical search and mathematical optimization techniques. 
The process is sometimes referred to as "goal seeking". 
If a designer's goals are expressed in terms of one-sided constraints 
or two-sided "FIXes", the software can search for and find a "feasible" solution, if one exists. 
Once a feasible solution is established, the software can seek an "optimal" solution 
that provides the best solution available within the established constraints. 

&nbsp; 

## PLATFORM   

The ODOP software is based on a problem independent core ... the "platform" on which 
any number of mathematical models (a.k.a. "Design Types") can be built. 
The core solution techniques (Search, Seek and Trade) may then be applied to 
those mathematical models in order to evolve specific designs. 
Designs may be stored in a design library for later re-use. 
Specific design types may offer problem-specific reports that may be saved or printed. 
Specific design types may offer easy selection from tables of material properties 
or the ability to select from catalogs of standard component sizes or even 
catalogs of stock designs.

## Design Types   

Five [Design Types](/docs/Help/DesignTypes) are currently available. 

![Compression Spring Design Type icon](https://odop.springdesignsoftware.org/designtypes/Spring/Compression/favicon.ico "Compression Spring Design Type") 
![Extension Spring Design Type icon](https://odop.springdesignsoftware.org/designtypes/Spring/Extension/favicon.ico "Extension Spring Design Type") 
![Torsion Spring Design Type icon](https://odop.springdesignsoftware.org/designtypes/Spring/Torsion/favicon.ico "Torsion Spring Design Type") 
The **Compression, Extension and Torsion Spring** design types are full-featured apps 
enabling the engineering design of helical coil springs. 
While best saved for a time after your initial introduction to ODOP is complete, 
a comprehensive introduction to coil spring design with ODOP is available at 
[Spring Design Topics](/docs/Help/SpringDesign). 

![Rectangular Solid Design Type icon](https://odop.springdesignsoftware.org/designtypes/Solid/favicon.ico "Rectangular Solid Design Type") 
The [Rectangular Solid](/docs/Help/DesignTypes/Solid/description.html) design type is intended as an 
easy to understand demonstration problem. 

![Piston-Cylinder Design Type icon](https://odop.springdesignsoftware.org/designtypes/Piston-Cylinder/favicon.ico "Piston-Cylinder Design Type") 
The [Piston-Cylinder](/docs/Help/DesignTypes/Piston-Cylinder/description.html) design type is a simple demonstration problem 
that illustrates competing objectives.
