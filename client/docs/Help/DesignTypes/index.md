# Design Types

See [Terminology](/docs/Help/terminology.html#designTypes) for more detail on usage of the term "Design Types".   

Currently available Design Types include full-featured apps for the design of
helical coil springs.
These are:   

* [Compression Spring](/docs/Help/DesignTypes/Spring/Compression/description.html)   
* [Extension Spring](/docs/Help/DesignTypes/Spring/Extension/description.html)   
* [Torsion Spring](/docs/Help/DesignTypes/Spring/Torsion/description.html)   
&nbsp;

See [Spring Design Topics](/docs/Help/SpringDesign) for more detail on spring design with ODOP.

Two relatively simple demonstration cases are also available.
These are:   

* [Rectangular Solid](/docs/Help/DesignTypes/Solid/description.html)   
* [Piston-Cylinder](/docs/Help/DesignTypes/Piston-Cylinder/description.html)
