# Advanced Spring Operations 

## Design to Stress   
 If you want to avoid dealing with the ODOP:Spring "factor of safety" approach 
 and design a spring in a more traditional "design to specific stress" 
 approach, this is possible. 

 A method of getting ODOP:Spring to find a design with a specific working 
 stress is presented here. 
 Another approach that allows the user to have complete control over the 
 allowable stresses that are used in the factor of safety calculations 
 is presented in the [MATERIALS](materials.html) section. 

 First, it will be necessary to free the various FS_ constraints so that 
 they are no longer active. 
 This is accomplished by removing the checkmark in front of the specified 
 MIN and MAX constraints. 

    For compression springs:        For extension springs:
    FREE    FS_2                    FREE    FS_2
    FREE    FS_CycleLife            FREE    FS_CycleLife
    FREE    FS_Solid                FREE    FS_Hook

 Next it will be necessary to tell ODOP:Spring to find a solution with the 
 desired stress (substitute your desired stress level for xxxxx below). 

    FIX Stress_2  xxxxxx

 Finally, enter the rest of your problem's FIX and constraint information, 
 then go to the [Search](/docs/Help/search.html) menu item (**Action : Search** menu) 
 to have ODOP:Spring find a design with the requested stress level at the second 
 working position. 

 Note that as with the "factor of safety approach" it may be desirable to 
 use the [Seek](/docs/Help/seek.html) menu item (**Action : Seek** menu) to find a 
 spring of minimum weight. 

 Also, while it is likely not a significant concern, 
 remember that fixing any Dependent Variable (like Stress\_2) will 
 increase the difficulty of the search problem and thus potentially increase 
 the time required to execute the search. 

## Prop_Calc_Method   
 The value of Prop\_Calc\_Method controls how material properties and 
 allowable stresses are determined and used. 

 Prop\_Calc\_Method = 1 - Use values from material table 
 indicates values come from materials table; 
 allowable stresses will be calculated as a function of Wire_Dia. 

 Prop\_Calc\_Method = 2 - Use Tensile & %\_Tensile_... 
 indicates Tensile and allowable %\_Tensile 
 (%\_Tensile\_Endur and %\_Tensile\_Stat) 
 are supplied by the user; 
 allowable stresses (Stress\_Lim\_Endur and Stress\_Lim\_Stat) are calculated. 
 There is no dependence on wire diameter. 

 Prop\_Calc\_Method = 3 - Use Stress\_Lim_... 
 indicates that allowable stresses 
 (Stress\_Lim\_Endur and Stress\_Lim\_Stat) 
 are supplied directly by the user. 
 There is no dependence on wire diameter. 

 Refer to additional discussion in the [MATERIALS](materials.html) section. 
 
## Hot Wound   
 The easiest way to design a hot wound spring is to open a start point 
 that is already set up for hot wound. 
 Sample compression spring hot wound startup designs supplied with ODOP:Spring 
 (marked "[ReadOnly]") are: 

    HotWound       - U.S. customary units (inches, pounds) 
    HotWoundMetric - metric units (mm, Newtons)

 Each of these files are pre-configured for a material type (Eg. 5160H) 
 that carries an appropriate value of HOT\_FACTOR_KH, an end type of 
 TAPERED_C&G, and starting values that are closer to the solution point of a 
 typical hot large wound spring than the values in the default startup design. 

 Alternately, select a material from the table that indicates it is "hot wound", 
 select an appropriate end type (Eg. TAPERED\_C&G) 
 and then adjust Wire\_Dia, OD\_Free and Force\_2 to start 
 with a realistic approximation of the desired result. 

 The value of HOT\_FACTOR\_KH is used to reduce the effective modulus of 
 elasticity and torsional modulus in the design equations. 

 For normal cold coiled materials, the value of HOT\_FACTOR\_KH is 1.00. 
 Thus, it has no effect on the modulus. 
 For materials designated as "hot wound" in the materials table, 
 the value of HOT\_FACTOR\_KH is automatically established as appropriate 
 (generally 0.96 for centerless ground materials 
 and 0.91 for not centerless ground materials). 

       PROCESS           MATERIAL         HOT_FACTOR_KH
    
     COLD_COILED                               1.00
     HOT_WOUND       CENTERLESS GROUND         0.96
     HOT_WOUND       NOT   CL   GROUND         0.91

 It is possible to set a different value for HOT\_FACTOR\_KH by 
 using PROP\_CALC\_METHOD = 2 or 3. 
 This will permit any desired 
 value of HOT\_FACTOR\_KH to be entered into the Advanced View 
 Calculation Input entry field. 

 Make permanent changes in these values by altering the appropriate 
 materials file.
