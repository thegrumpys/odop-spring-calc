## Spring Design References

 There are many excellent sources of information on spring design.  Several
 on the following list were consulted in the development of the ODOP:Spring
 program.  No single source contains a comprehensive set of equations and/or
 material property values found in ODOP:Spring.  The references are presented
 in alphabetical order by title.
