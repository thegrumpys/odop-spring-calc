By default, ODOP:Spring gets material property data from the materials table. 
Alternate material tables may be provided to contain material 
property values that match locally available materials or individual 
experience and preferences. 
Thus, the currently active materials table may 
not match the default table described above. 
For additional information, refer to: 
* [Restrictions](/docs/Help/../About/Legal/Restrictions.html) 
* [NewDesignType](/docs/Help/../procedures/NewDesignType.html) 

The way that ODOP:Spring handles material property data is dependent on the 
user specified settings of the Calculation Inputs: Material\_Type and 
Prop\_Calc\_Method. 
Note that by default, when using a material selected from the materials table, 
allowable stresses are calculated as a function of wire diameter. 
In general, the user may ignore these details and use 
the defaults built into the program. 
Establish material property values simply by selecting a Material\_Type. 
In the case that more control of material property data entering 
the calculations is desired, the details provided below and in 
[Prop_Calc_Method](/docs/Help/SpringDesign/advancedSpringOperations.html) may be useful. 

Examples of these procedures are presented in tutorial section TUTOR5. 

The Material\_Type is used to indicate which entry in 
the material table should be used to determine material 
properties and allowable stress limits. 
Specifically, the term "material properties" includes the values for 
Density, Torsion\_Modulus, and Tensile. 
The term "allowable stress limits" includes values for Stress\_Lim\_Stat and 
Stress\_Lim\_Endur which are normally calculated based on the material 
properties plus the current value of Wire\_Dia combined with %\_Tensile\_Stat 
and %\_Tensile\_Endur. 

To use a material that is not in the material table, or to use 
material property values that are different than those contained in the 
table, it is necessary to select an alternate setting for Prop\_Calc\_Method. 

ODOP:Spring will treat material properties in one of three different ways 
depending on the value of the constant Prop\_Calc\_Method. 

If Prop\_Calc\_Method has a value of **1 - Use values from material table** 
(the normal default), then the 
material properties are selected and allowable stresses calculated as 
previously described. 
Specifically, if Prop\_Calc\_Method has a value of 1, 
ODOP:Spring will calculate the allowable stresses as a function of Wire\_Dia. 
A log-linear interpolation scheme will use the values of Wire\_Dia, plus the 
table supplied values of tensile at 0.010, tensile at 0.400, 
%\_Tensile\_Stat, and %\_Tensile\_Endur to calculate new values for Tensile, 
Stress\_Lim\_Stat and Stress\_Lim\_Endur at each step in the Search process. 
This insures that the allowable stresses used in the factor of safety 
calculations exactly match the trial values of Wire\_Dia selected by Search. 

If Prop\_Calc\_Method has a value of **2 - Use Tensile & %\_Tensile_...**, 
the user supplied values of Tensile, %\_Tensile\_Stat and 
%\_Tensile\_Endur are used to calculate the allowable stresses 
Stress\_Lim\_Stat and Stress\_Lim\_Endur. 

If Prop\_Calc\_Method is set to a value of **3 - Use Stress_Lim_...**, 
then ODOP:Spring will not modify the values of 
Stress\_Lim\_Stat and Stress\_Lim\_Endur in any way.
These values will remain as established in the initial start point ("Startup") 
or as set by the user in the Advanced View Calculation Input section. 
The values of Material\_Type, Tensile, %\_Tensile\_Stat and %\_Tensile\_Endur 
will be ignored. 

In most cases, the user does not need to be concerned with these details. 
They are necessary only to use material properties or allowable stresses 
that are different from those determined by the materials table. 

The following example illustrates how to establish a value of 
Torsion\_Modulus that is different from the value in the material table. 
Stress\_Lim\_Stat and Stress\_Lim\_Endur will continue to be based on the 
current values of Tensile plus 
%\_Tensile\_Stat and %\_Tensile\_Endur whether established by the user or 
carried over from the values established in the materials table or startup. 
The order in which these changes are entered is significant. 

    CHANGE Prop_Calc_Method 2 - Use Tensile & %_Tensile_...
    CHANGE Torsion_Modulus  xxxxxxxx

The same process applies to changing values for %\_Tensile\_Stat and %\_Tensile\_Endur. 

The following example illustrates how to establish a value of 
%\_Tensile\_Stat that is different from the value in the material table. 
Stress\_Lim\_Stat and Stress\_Lim\_Endur will continue to be based on the new 
value of %\_Tensile\_Stat and existing value of %\_Tensile\_Endur. 
The order in which these changes are entered is significant. 

    CHANGE Prop_Calc_Method 2 - Use Tensile & %_Tensile_... 
    CHANGE %_Tensile_STAT  xxxxxxxx 

 The following example illustrates how to establish values of 
 Torsion\_Modulus, Stress\_Lim\_Stat and Stress\_Lim\_Endur. 
 There will be no dependence on the Wire\_Dia or any values from the materials table. 
 The order in which these changes are entered is significant. 

    CHANGE  Prop_Calc_Method  3 - Use Stress_Lim_... 
    CHANGE  Torsion_Modulus   xxxxxxxx 
    CHANGE  Stress_Lim_Stat   yyyyyy 
    CHANGE  Stress_Lim_Endur  zzzzzz 

The **File : Save** menu item will capture the complete status of the design including 
the material property information. 
After using the **File : Open...** menu item to read a 
previously saved design, the complete status of the design will be restored. 

Additional information on controlling the way material property data is 
used in the calculations is presented in the section 
[Design to Stress](/docs/Help/SpringDesign/advancedSpringOperations.html).
