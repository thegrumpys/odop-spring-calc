# Getting Started   

This page utilizes the Rectangular Solid demonstration case to provide a quick 
and less technical introduction to the ODOP software. 
For a more spring design specific introduction, see: &nbsp; 
[Getting Started With the Spring Design Tutorial and Demo](gettingStartedSpring.html)

<hr/>

 Getting started with any computer program, ODOP included, 
 is usually a matter of ...  Try it.  You'll like it !   
 
 Dive in and bash away at the program. 
 It's not possible to break anything and a little experimentation
 usually goes a long way.  In the worst case, you'll come away from the
 experience with a little more motivation to read more of the on-line documentation.

As noted in the discussion on other Help pages, ODOP currently offers five
design types to work with.
These include full-featured apps for compression, extension and torsion spring design 
plus the Rectangular Solid and Piston-Cylinder demonstration cases. 
If you are interested in learning about capabilities, concepts, and basic
mechanics of how to operate the program,
the Rectangular Solid design type is intended as a small and easy to understand 
demonstration problem and is a good place to start. 
The remainder of this Getting Started topic will use the Rectangular Solid design type
to describe several screen captures that refer to the ODOP main page.

Note that the [Terminology](terminology.html) page of the on-line documentation may be 
helpful with some of the terms utilized here.

If you haven't seen it already, the 
[ODOP Design Process Flow Diagram](/docs/About/img/DesignProcessFlowDiagram.png)
provides an important conceptual introduction to the overall design process within ODOP.   

The ODOP software expects to start from an existing design. 
More information on this point is available at [Default Designs](/docs/Help/defaultDesigns.html).

While a user account is not required to access the ODOP software,
an account with associated username and password is necessary to save designs into 
the cloud-based ODOP "Design Library".
See: [User Accounts](/docs/About/userAccounts.html) for details on
how to obtain an account.

The material below assumes that you will be able to operate the ODOP program in one browser
window (or tab) at the same time that you are able to view this on-line Help material in a
different browser window (or tab). 
See [Launching the Program](launchODOP.html) for more detailed instructions on 
how to get the program up and running with this multiple browser window (tab) configuration.

&nbsp;

Before continuing with the material below, 
please confirm that the ODOP program is running in a browser window (or tab) 
and that the Rectangular Solid design type is loaded.
You should see Independent Variables like Length, Width and Height.
If you see the Independent Variables of the Compression Spring design type 
(OD\_Free, Wire\_Dia, L\_Free, etc.),
go to the **File : Open** menu, 
drop down the box under "Select design type to open:", 
select the "Solid" design type and click the "Open" button.   

This screen capture illustrates selecting the Rectangular **Solid** design type 
and its default design called **Startup**.   
![Start with Rectangular Solid](/docs/Help/img/SelectSolid.png "Start with Rectangular Solid")   

&nbsp;

## A Quick Tour of the Main Page   

Have a look at the main menu (**File &nbsp; Action &nbsp; View &nbsp; Help**) 
highlighted inside the red oval.
Select one of the main menu entries and a drop-down with sub-items will appear.   
![Main Menu](/docs/Help/img/MainMenu.png "Main Menu")   

&nbsp;

Here is an example of how each main menu item will drop down to provide 
specific menu items.
Note that menu entries associated with not yet implemented features are disabled (gray).
This screen clip illustrates how to get to the index of Help pages.   
![Help Index](/docs/Help/img/HelpIndex.png "Help Index")   

&nbsp;

At the upper right of the main page you see 
an icon associated with the design type (a rectangular box in this case) and
the name of the specific design that is currently open.
![Design Type Icon - Design Name](/docs/Help/img/TabIconName.png "[Design Type Icon - Design Name")   

&nbsp;

The Result section is positioned near the top of the main page.
This area provides feedback about the solution process.   
![Result Section](/docs/Help/img/ResultSection.png "Result Section")   

&nbsp;

If you hover the cursor over a heading or a variable name, 
a tool-tip will pop up to provide more information regarding each item.   
![Result Section ToolTip](/docs/Help/img/ResultSectionToolTip.png "Result Section ToolTip")   

&nbsp;

There are numeric entry fields for each of the variables.
The user can change the value of Independent Variables by positioning
the cursor in the field and over-writing the existing value.
Recalculation will happen immediately.
The Dependent Variables, constraint violations and Objective Function will 
immediately reflect the result of the new value for that Independent Variable.   
![Independent Variables](/docs/Help/img/Independent.png "Independent Variables")   

&nbsp;

In order change the value of a Dependent Variable, it is necessary
to FIX (see below) its value and then execute the Search function
(Action : Search menu).   
![Dependent Variables](/docs/Help/img/Dependent.png "Dependent Variables")   

&nbsp;

Calculation Inputs are quantities that can be modified by the user
but are not subject to Constraints, FIX or manipulation by the Search process. 
You will likely need to scroll down to see the section containing Calculation Inputs.   
![Calculation Inputs](/docs/Help/img/CalcInput.png "Calculation Inputs")   

&nbsp;

This clip illustrates how a Calculation Input with a drop-down arrow 
can expand into a table that the user can select from.
In this case, the user selects a material and the appropriate 
material property values (density in this case) are provided to the calculations.   
![Calculation Input Table](/docs/Help/img/CalcInputTable.png "Calculation Input Table")   

&nbsp;

Constraints are single sided (Max or Min) limits imposed on the 
selected Variable. 
First, mark the checkbox and then enter a value in the entry field.
The amount of constraint violation will be immediately recalculated;
a positive value if violated or a negative value if satisfied.
The Objective Value will reflect the aggregate impact of all violated constraints.
This example illustrates the 108 inch Max limit on Length+Girth
and the 70 pound Max limit on weight that is common to many
carriers in the package shipping industry.   
![Constraints](/docs/Help/img/Constraint.png "Constraints")   

&nbsp;

In order to FIX the value of an Independent Variable, put a check
in the box immediately to the right of its value.
Note the checkboxes highlighted by the red oval in  this example.   
![FIX an Independent Variable](/docs/Help/img/IV_Fix.png "FIX an Independent Variable")   

&nbsp;

In order to FIX the value of a Dependent Variable, put a check 
in the box immediately to the right of its value.
This will cause both associated constraints to be checked and the 
corresponding constraint entry fields to become available for input.
Enter the FIX value into either entry field.
Thus, the FIX of a Dependent Variable is effectively a double-sided constraint.   
![FIX a Dependent Variable](/docs/Help/img/DV_Fix.png "FIX a Dependent Variable")

## Using Help   

The quick tour of the main page is now complete.
This is a good time to get a better look at what is available 
in the on-line documentation. 
Most of the entries that are available after selecting the **Help : Index** menu 
item cover the generic features and capabilities of the ODOP software.
So, as you are reading, please click the Help menu.
It will drop down to provide a list of entries (topics) to choose from.
Selecting <b>Index</b> on this list will bring up a new browser tab with the
list of available Help entries. 
You can switch back and forth between the browser tabs.
 If time is available, read through those entries from top to bottom.   
 ![Help Index](/docs/Help/img/HelpIndex.png "Help Index")   
  
 On-line documentation for ODOP:Spring appears in the Spring Design topic.

## Help Lookup   

A full-text index of the on-line help is available.

## Using the Tutorial and Demo Facility   

 The tutorial is designed to introduce new users to ODOP concepts, 
 features and menus. 
 It is recommended for new users as the most effective and
 organized way of learning the program.  

Tutorial sessions are fairly brief.
In most cases, the user is not required to do anything more complicated than
read and hit the **Next** button.
Each tutorial session covers a specific operation or capability of the software.
It is possible to stop a tutorial / demo session at any point.

Demonstration sessions are available for the spring design types and 
illustrate problem solving techniques as well as provide sample solutions 
to several generally available reference book problems.
The focus is on solving the problem, not explaining the operation of the software.
