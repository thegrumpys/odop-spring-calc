# Errors &nbsp; 

This topic provides details for various messages produced by the software 
including each of the error conditions that may block the 
Action : Search, Seek, Trade and Catalog functions.

## Invalid Value messages 
Each Independent Variable, Dependent Variable and numeric Calculation Input has a predefined range 
(validmin to validmax) for which it is considered to be valid. 
If a variable has a value outside this range, it is said to be "invalid". 
Just as Search will work to stay within constraint boundaries, 
it will work to keep each variable within its valid range. 

Most commonly, negative values for quantities like diameters are considered to be invalid.

The Alerts facility will identify variables that have values outside their valid range. 
Press the Alerts button to see a list of active alerts. 
Any variables with values outside their valid range will be identified as "INVALID VALUE". 
Independent Variables can be modified directly and are sorted to the top of the list. 
As Dependent Variables cannot be modified directly, 
they are classified with "Info" severity and sorted to the bottom of the list. 
Select the entry in the "Value" column to modify the associated variable's value or the value of its constraints.

## Search Errors 
Conditions that block operation of the Search feature include: 
 - [No free independent variables](/docs/Help/alerts.html#NoFreeIV) 
 - [Constraints are inconsistent](/docs/Help/alerts.html#Constraint_Inconsistency) 

Follow the link above that corresponds to the message blocking Search.

#### Invalid Values
While usually a situation of having started with invalid values,
it is possible for Search to return a design that contains invalid values. 
The Help links provided in the Alerts panel may provide specific recommendations to help clear the condition. 
In some cases it may be necessary to identify which input(s) are responsible for the invalid values and then
manually adjust the value of those inputs so as to clear the invalid condition. 

#### Objective Value not finite
A design with an Objective Value of infinity or [NaN](errors.html#NaN) will not block Search.
Rather, a warning pop-up will provide an opportunity to cancel the search request and 
examine the Alerts feature for details and context specific guidance. 

Use the AutoSave feature to recover a design as it existed before a Search.

## Seek Errors 
 Conditions that block the operation of Seek include: 
 - [No free independent variables](/docs/Help/alerts.html#NoFreeIV) 
 - [Constraints are inconsistent](/docs/Help/alerts.html#Constraint_Inconsistency) 

Follow the link above that corresponds to the message blocking Search.

Use the AutoSave feature to recover a design as it existed before a Seek.

## Catalog Errors 

Use the AutoSave feature to recover a design as it existed before use of the Select Catalog feature.

##  Objective Value not finite
  
A design with an Objective Value that is not finite (more specifically, a value of infinity or [NaN](errors.html#NaN)) has numeric issues. 
One or more design variable values or perhaps a specific combination of values are causing the difficulty.  

Continuing with Search may not result in an improvement.  

Canceling Search will allow you to examine the Alerts panel for invalid values and associated guidance. 
Freeing one or more independent variables followed by a new search may result in an improvement.  

Note that the [AutoFix](/docs/Help/terminology.html#autoFix) feature may contribute to unintentionally 
placing [Independent Variables](/docs/Help/terminology.html#independentVar) in [Fixed](/docs/Help/terminology.html#fix) status.
